The Smart design system provides 2 distinct typographic styles. The document style is meant for documents that are meant to be read (i.e. content websites such as this one).

The UI style is meant for user interfaces - usually for the display of a lot of information in a condensed space.

Add a <code>.c-text</code> (for the UI style) or <code>.c-content</code> (for the document style) class as a parent to your typographic HTML elements to “activate” rich typography. Rich typography means default styling of base elements like h1, h2, h3 but also paragraphs and lists.
