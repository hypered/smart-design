title: Panel grid with predefined columns
---

To define cell widths within a direction-level, instead of the individual cell level, add the class `.[size]-up-[n]` to a panel-grid, where `[n]` is the number of cells to display per direction, and `[size]` is the breakpoint at which to apply the effect.

Available sizes: `small`, `medium`, `large`, `extra-large`

Max columns: 6 (can be overridden by setting `$o-panel-grid-max-columns`)
