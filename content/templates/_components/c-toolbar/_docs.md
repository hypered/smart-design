title: Toolbar
---

The toolbar is meant as a generic construct to position UI elements. It provides a structure where you can position items on the left, in the center and on the right.

The toolbar requires a parent `.c-toolbar` div that contains children that define the positioning: `.c-toolbar__left`, `.c-toolbar__right` and `.c-toolbar__center`.

The toolbar construct is used in many parts of the user interface: dialogs, panels, navbars and popovers all use the toolbar component to position elements in a consistent way.
