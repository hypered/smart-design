                            p The Struct design system is currently split among various places. The main work is at <a href="https://hypered.design">hypered.design</a>. There you can find the Next.js -based debut of the design system. There is also an attempt at a different approach using ITCSS/BEM. Here, you can find a modified ITCSS/BEM design system (originally created by Mono for Smart) that should converge towards the other work.
