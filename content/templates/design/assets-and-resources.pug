            p You can find Smartâ€™s design files on Figma community. Community files exist mostly to show what the design system is all about publicly. If you are serious about contributing, see the links and notes below. These are the links for the files:

            p The design uses <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/" target="_blank">Inter</a> as its primary font. Inter is a font that is available in Figma by default, and you shouldn't need to install anything to use it.

            p Inter is a variable font family designed for computer screens by <a href="https://rsms.me/" target="_blank">Rasmus Andersson</a>. Inter is available in nine weights with matching italics, as well as a variable font version.

            p Should you need a desktop version, you can download Inter <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/" target="_blank">here</a>.
