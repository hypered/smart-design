# Smart Design System

This repository contains the design system website hosted at <a href="https://design.smart.coop/">design.smart.coop</a>. This site describes how to contribute to the design system from a design and development perspective. A big part of the site is <a href="https://design.smart.coop/development/component-documentation.html">the component documentation</a> where you can find copy/pastable HTML and CSS for common components. The Figma design files can be found on our [Figma community profile](https://www.figma.com/@smartcoop).

This website uses Bedrock in the background, which is a static site generator specialized in showing design systems. For instructions, view the README <a href="https://github.com/usebedrock/bedrock">here</a>.
